GraphQLite is a framework agnostic library. You can use it in any PHP projects as long a you know how to
inject services in your favorite framework's container.

Currently, we provide an additional bundle to help you get started with Symfony. More frameworks will be supported soon.

- [Get started with Symfony](symfony-bundle.md)
- [Get started with another framework (or no framework)](other_frameworks.md)
